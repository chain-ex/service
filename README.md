## Easy Blockchain

Decentralized services are increasingly being developed and their proper usage in different areas is being experimented with. 

Autonomous codes, which are also called smart contracts, can be developed with Integrated Development Environments (IDE). However, these tools lack live environment tests. 

The underlying blockchain technologies are also evolving and it is not easy to catch all the developments. There is a need for an easy-to-use interface by which the developers can see the results of their codes. 

Chainex decentralized application development workbench is developed to serve as an efficient way for the programmers to deploy smart contracts on the blockchain networks and interact with them easily. 

It can also be used for teaching decentralized application programming for junior blockchain developers on blockchain testbeds. 


Finally, it will have an effect in decreasing the development time and the costs of developing decentralized application projects.

You can use this service to connect your preferred blockchain, ethereum systems easily.
